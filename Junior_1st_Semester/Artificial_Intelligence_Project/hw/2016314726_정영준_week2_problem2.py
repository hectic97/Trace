"""Sigma means net value == x1*x1+x2*x2+w3
first row: x1 = 0, x2= 0, Sigma = -0.5  plug in that values to net   0+0+w3 = -0.5  so w3 = -0.5
second row: x1 = 0, x2 = 1, Sigma = 0.5 plug in that numbers to equation 0+w2-0.5 = 0.5 So w2 = 1
third row:  x1 = 1, x2 = 0 Same as previous equation So w1 = 1
Thus, w1 = 1  ,w2 = 1 ,w3 = -0.5"""

print("w1 = 1, w2 = 1, w3 = -0.5")
